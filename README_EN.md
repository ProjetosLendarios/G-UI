# G-UI

![G-UI Logo](path/to/logo.png)

G-UI is a fresh restart of the T-UI console-style Android launcher, fully rewritten in **Kotlin**, carrying over the best of the original code and upgraded to support the latest Android SDKs and libraries.

## 🚀 What's New

- **Complete rewrite in Kotlin** for safer, more concise code  
- **Modernized dependencies**: AndroidX, Kotlin Coroutines, OkHttp 5.x, Jetpack libraries  
- **Upgraded UI**: improved performance, theming, and accessibility  
- **Modular architecture**: easier to maintain and extend

## 📖 Overview

G-UI provides a terminal-like interface to launch apps, run shell commands, and integrate with Android services—all in one lightweight, keyboard-driven launcher.

## ⚙️ Features

- Command palette for apps, contacts, music, RSS, and more  
- Alias and scripting support  
- Built-in hints, suggestions, and redirection  
- Notification and background service integration  
- Customizable status lines (time, battery, RAM, network, storage, weather, unlock counter)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProjetosLendarios/G-UI.git
   ```
2. Open in Android Studio (Arctic Fox or later)
